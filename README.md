## Overview

This project is designed to create a temperature-controlled access system using an Atmega 32 microcontroller. It includes components such as a Temperature Sensor (LM35), DC Motor, Keypad, LCD, LEDs, and an Atmega 32 microcontroller. The system allows users to enter a password via the keypad, and upon successful login, they can control LEDs and monitor the temperature.

## Operation

### User Authentication:

1. When the user powers on the system, it displays the message on the LCD: "Please Enter Password."

2. The user enters a password through the keypad.

3. If the user enters the correct password, the system displays a successful login message, such as "Welcome Ahmed."

4. If the user enters an incorrect password, the system displays the message: "Wrong password, please try again."

5. The user has a maximum of 3 attempts to enter the correct password; after that, the system locks for 2 minutes.

### Post-Login:

6. After a successful login, the system displays the following options on the LCD:
   - Option 1: Turn LEDs ON
   - Option 2: Turn LEDs OFF
   - The user can choose to control LEDs using the keypad.

### Temperature Monitoring:

7. The system continuously monitors the temperature sensor (LM35).

8. Temperature Control:
   - If the temperature is less than or equal to 25째C, the DC motor remains off.
   - If the temperature is greater than 25째C but less than 30째C, the DC motor operates at half speed.
   - If the temperature is greater than or equal to 30째C, the DC motor operates at full speed.

## Code Details

### Code Structure:

The project code is organized into four main files, following a modular and structured approach for maintainability and readability:

1. `main.c`: The main program file that controls the system's overall operation.
2. `adc.c`: Contains functions to configure and read data from the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) peripheral in Single Conversion Mode for reading the LM35 sensor.
3. `timer.c`: Includes functions to configure Timer0 in Fast PWM Mode for generating pulses and controlling the DC motor's speed.
4. `lcd.c`: Contains functions to control the LCD display in 8-bit mode to provide information to the user.

### Peripheral Usage:

- **ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter):** The LM35 temperature sensor data is read using the ADC in Single Conversion Mode.

- **Timer0 (Fast PWM Mode):** Timer0 is used to generate pulses with specific duty cycles to control the DC motor's speed.

- **LCD:** The 8-bit mode of the LCD is utilized to display messages and options to the user.

- **Keypad:** The keypad is used to input the password from the user.
